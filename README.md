# UnforgivingDevices
LL link: https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/16938-unforgiving-devices/

This mod is in active development! This means every new version requires new save. Also i don't recommend using this mod for serious playthrough yet. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy this mod but just don't be dissapointed if something get broken.

 
My goal with this mod is to make custom devices with custom behavier. My vision is to convert all devices from framework and give them custom behavier that will be more punishing and realistic for player. With that i mean something along this line: Gas mask will actualy work like gas masks, reducing player ability to breath. Collars can choke player. Moving in restrictive boots will hurt player. Trying to swim with heavy bondage will drown player.

This are all examples of what I want to archieve in this mod (not what is currently in this mod yet).
